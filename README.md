# [Functional Programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)

If you try to solve a problem named "Something-new-problem" of "Introduction"
domain, then you would make some boilerplate or just run script file like this.
```
intro$ ../add.sh Something-new-problem
```
It will make new sbt subproject for same name and create directories for source
and test. But you will fill some items of list(domain and problem) by your own
hand. manually. We need to cry.


### Table of Subdomains

1. [Introduction](intro/)
